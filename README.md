# Loneliness-Risk-Detection
# Loneliness Risk Detection in Students 🎓

This project uses a synthetic dataset to explore behavioral and emotional patterns among students that may indicate loneliness. The goal is to build a simple machine learning model to predict who might be at risk.

## 📁 Files

- `loneliness_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook for data analysis, visualization & ML
- `generate_dataset.py`: Python script to generate balanced dummy dataset
- `loneliness_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset used in the project

## 🔍 Features Considered

- Screen Time
- Time Spent Alone
- Sleep Quality
- Mood Stability
- Social Activity
- City Type (Urban / Semi-Urban)
- Age

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Label Encoding
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees

## 📌 Outcome

Successfully trained a Decision Tree model to predict loneliness with good accuracy and visualized key contributing features.
